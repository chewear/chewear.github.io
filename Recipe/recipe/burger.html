    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes</li>
            <li>8 cups peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>14 ounces ground chuck</li>
            <li>4 thick slices American cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 medium sesame seed burger buns</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>2 thick slices tomato</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut potatoes in ½-inch wide strips.</li>
            <li>Place the potato strips in a large bowl filled with warm water and soak for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour oil in a Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack on top.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked potatoes well and dry them thoroughly with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Add ½ of the dried potatoes to the hot oil and cook, stirring often, until they soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove potatoes to the wire rack to drain.</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous step with the remaining potatoes.</li>
            <li>Maintain oil temperature at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for finishing fries just before serving.</li>
            <li>Divide ground chuck into 4 portions and flatten to form ¼-inch thick patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add burger patties to the hot skillet and cook undisturbed, until a brown crust has formed around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the patties, press down with a spatula to flatten, and cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the patties again, press down once more, then top each patty with a slice of cheese; cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>While the burgers cook, spread mustard and ketchup on the bottom halves of the buns.</li>
            <li>Drizzle hot sauce on the top halves of the buns, then spread mayonnaise over the top halves.</li>
            <li>Layer the bottom halves of the buns with lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and onions.</li>
            <li>Invert 1 patty onto a second patty so the cheese sides are touching. Repeat with remaining 2 patties.</li>
            <li>Place a stacked patty onto each top bun, and cover with a bottom bun, condiment-side down. Wrap burgers in foil.</li>
            <li>Return the fries to the hot oil and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the fries on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Serve the burgers immediately with the fries.</li>
        </ol>
